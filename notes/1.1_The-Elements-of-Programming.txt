Applicative order evaluation vs normal order evaluation
-------------------------------------------------------
    Normal order: "Fully expand and then reduce"
    Applicative-order: "Evaluate the arguments then apply"
They will yield the same result when procedure applications 
can be modeled using substitution and that yield legitimate values.

Local Names
-----------
    Bound variable: a name given to a formal parameter 
                    that does not necessarily have the
                    same name as in the definition
    Bind(verb): the action of taking variables used with 
    '           the procedure and associating them to 
                the formal parameters.
    free(variable): not bound

    scope: the set of expressions for which a binding 
            defines a name
